        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz package Medjool Date</li>
            <li>1/2 cup peanut butter, thick and creamy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup melted semi-sweet, milk, or dark chocolate</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped peanuts</li>
            <li>flakey sea salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <ul>
         <ol>
            <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>
                Cut the Medjool dates open down the middle and remove the pit.

            </li>
            <li>
                Press the Medjool date down on the parchment paper, with the 
                inside facing down. Repeat with the rest of the dates making 
                sure they are tightly packed side by side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread on a thin layer of peanut butter on top. You can pop 
                it in the fridge at this step or just continue to the next 
                step.

            <li>Add the chocolate to a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 
                30-second intervals on low power. Mix between each interval 
                until fully melted.</li>
            <li>
                Pour the chocolate over the peanut butter and use the back 
                of a spoon or rubber spatula to spread it into a thin layer.
            <li>
                Sprinkle on chopped peanuts and flakey sea salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer to the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes until the 
                    chocolate is set and firm to touch.</li>
            <li>Remove from the fridge and transfer to a cutting board.

            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the bark into equal sections. You can make the squares 
                    as small or as big as you'd like.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy now or store in an air-tight container in the fridge!

            </li>
