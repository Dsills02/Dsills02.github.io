            James Cameron's "Titanic" is an epic, action-packed romance set
            against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic; the 
            pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest
            moving object ever built. She was the most luxurious liner of her 
            era -- the "ship of dreams" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500
            people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North
            Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.

            Estella is a young and clever grifter who's determined to make a 
            name for herself in the fashion world. She soon meets a pair of 
            thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together 
            they build a life for themselves on the streets of London. However, 
            when Estella befriends fashion legend Baroness von Hellman, she 
            embraces her wicked side to become the raucous and revenge-bent 
            Cruella.

            The comically dark tale centres around three children, Violet, 
            Klaus and baby Sunny, whose parents are killed in a fire which 
            also destroys their home - a tragic event which sets the tone for 
            the rest of the book. Sent to live with Count Olaf, a distant 
            relative, their unsettled lives take a turn for the worse.
