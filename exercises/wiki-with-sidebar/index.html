                        The stakes could not be higher for Beyoncé—an artist who
                        haschallenged herself at every turn—to do more, to be 
                        more, to say more. She has, throughout her solo career,
                        rewrite the rules of album releases, of stage 
                        performance, ofmusicvideos, of Black representation, 
                        of cultural legacy, and of self-expression. 
                        The final frontier of innovation, the 
                        only thing left for her to achieve, is to walk away 
                        from it all. And that’s what she’s trying to do these 
                        days—sort of.“I just quit my job,” she announces on 
                        “Break My Soul,” a clubby and joyous house track, on her
                        new album,“Renaissance.” “I’m looking for new
                        motivation.”

                        It’s been six years since Beyoncé released “Lemonade,” 
                        an album (and film) on which she laid bare her marital
                        strife, and subsequent reconciliation, with Jay-Z. The 
                        album was a feat of storytelling so ambitious that it 
                        made us reconsider what a modern pop star could 
                        accomplish. For years after its release,Beyoncé worked 
                        to expand the cultural footprint of “Lemonade,” 
                        first touring it in arenas around the world.

                In 2018, at Coache
                lla, she blew it out into a baroque theatrical production honori
                ng the legacy of Black collegiate marching bands. She followed 
                that performance with a documentary about her preparation for 
                the show, along with an accompanying live album called “Homecom
                ing.” That year, she and Jay-Z released “Everything Is Love,” a 
                joint album that was more a “Lemonade” victory lap than a new mu
                sical chapter. And yet the “Lemonade” era was so monumental that
                its long tail felt justified. Each iteration seemed to pump new
                fuel into the project.

            <h2 id="Explanation">Queen B's Explanation</h2>
            <p>
                Beyoncé seldom explains herself, but when she announced “Renaiss
                ance” she posted an unusually expository Instagram caption about
                its origins. She created the record, she said, “during a scary
                time for the world”—presumably a reference to the pandemic lock
                down. Making the album had allowed her to “feel free and advent
                rous in a time when little else was moving . . . a place to be f
                ree of perfectionism and overthinking.” And yet there is 
                nothing casual or ill considered on “Renaissance,” which is a 
                grand fe
                at of research, sampling, resource marshalling, and talent 
                mining. 
            </p>
            <h3>ICONIC BEHAVIOUR</h3>
            There is something bracing about a pop figurehead like Beyoncé 
            committing to “Renaissance” ’s level of aesthetic specificity. It’s
            a bold choice and a rejection of commercial interests in the 
            streaming-music era, which has ushered in a protracted dissolution 
            of genre barriers. In theory, the shift to streaming should have 
            enabled innovation; instead, it has helped squash distinct points 
            of view, and nudged many artists in the maudlin direction of easy 
            listening. 
            <h3 id="b and drake">Queen B and Drake</h3>
            Beyoncé’s and Drake’s experiments in genre might help 
            shift things back toward specificity. It is refreshing to imagine
            a future in which Taylor Swift records a pure country album, 
            Rihanna releases a dancehall album, Adele makes a gospel record, 
            and Rosalia returns to her flamenco roots.
